My name is Keith, and I'm a software engineer. Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this site to post about software, life, and anything else.

This site is a pretty simple Next.js app that essentially just renders markdown files. Each post is its own [markdown file](https://github.com/keithradford/keithradford.xyz/tree/master/_posts) that I store in the repository for this site. This approach is nice for a few reasons:

- markdown is simple and adds nice formatting to my blog posts
- using Next.js for SSR allows for quick loading of posts aswell as previews on links using Open Graph
- don't have to wrestle with creating a backend or another framework
- simple deployments on Vercel

This site is continuously being improved on and you can check the code out [here](https://github.com/keithradford/keithradford.xyz). If there's any problems with the site don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/keithradford/keithradford.xyz/issues/new)!
